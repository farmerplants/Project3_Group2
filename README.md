# UMN Fintech - Project 3 Group 2
## AGRO Token & Farming DAO

### We will be creating a dApp, DAO, and token system to benefit the education of farmers globally. In our MVP we will implement a "learn to earn" model structure for users to better understand various aspects about farming and the different commodities related to farming, a DAO for farmers to make various governance decisions and engage in community outreach, and a token system (AGRO token) built to suit this ecosystem.
