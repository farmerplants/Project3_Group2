## AGRO Token & Agro DAO

### We will be creating a DAO and token system to benefit the education of farmers globally. In our MVP we aim to implement a "learn to earn" model structure for users to better understand various aspects about farming and the different commodities related to farming, a DAO for farmers to make various governance decisions and engage in community outreach, and a token system (AGRO token) built to suit this ecosystem.
